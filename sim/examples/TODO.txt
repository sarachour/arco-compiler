# Performance Measures
Settling Time: Latency to get a stable result. Ie performance is settling-time*nsteps
Power Consumption: Need to determine this - we can use this (times computation time) to determine power consumption of circuit

# Circuit Property Measures 
Input Sensitivity: Determine the fluctuation in error with an input delta.
Range: Determine the valid input range from components.
