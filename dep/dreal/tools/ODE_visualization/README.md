Install
-------
 * First, install node.js[1] if you haven't installed. Visit
   http://nodejs.org
 * Install coffee-script by typing

     $ sudo npm install -g coffee-script

 * `make` generate `vis.javascript`
 * Type the following to run the simple Python web-server

     $ ./run_websvr.sh

   It should hang, so do not kill the server

 * Copy `xxx.smt2.json` file which is generated by dReal (with
   `--visualize`` option) to the ODE visualization folder (where you
   run the web-server)

 * Open a web-browser and type "http://localhost:8000/". You should see the
   visualization.
